# EDAProject
# Midterm project for ITP 449
# In this project, I analyzed a dataset of 1500+ post-flight interviews
# Using basic data exploration and visualiztion practices (with Pandas and Matplotlib) I arrived at several business conclusions
# for how airlines can profitably boost customer satisfaction
# My findings are documented in this blog: https://asarkisian99.medium.com/attaining-top-flight-customer-satisfaction-in-the-airline-industry-82194057f578
